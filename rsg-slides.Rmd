I am **not** speaking from authority here. Authority generally comes
from seniority, and in most cases senior academics aren't those that
have much experience in open and reproducible research.


I don't plan listing technical solutions on how to implement open
and reproducible research.


The real challenges are the (academic) environment we are in, the
inertia of academia and the vested interests of many senior actors.

## Open / reproducible != good

A piece of open research doesn't automatically make it good, where
good is defined as of high academic quality.

The **[Mertonian
norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms)** (1942)

- **Communism**: all scientists should have common ownership of scientific
  goods (intellectual property), to promote collective collaboration;
  secrecy is the opposite of this norm.

- **Universalism**: scientific validity is independent of the
  sociopolitical status/personal attributes of its participants.

- **Disinterestedness**: scientific institutions act for the benefit of a
  common scientific enterprise, rather than for the personal gain of
  individuals within them
  
- **Organised scepticism**: scientific claims should be exposed to
  critical scrutiny before being accepted: both in methodology and
  institutional codes of conduct.

## So what is open research?

## Don't exclude based on a definition of openness

So my very first take-home messages are:


> Open isn't binary, it's a gradient, it's multidisciplinary, it's
> multidimensional.

How to be an open scientist:

> Let's be open and understanding of different situations and
> constraints, including our own.

## Open research as a business: 
## ~~Open Access~~ 
## **Open Acce$$**

---
class: middle

- **Green open access**: post your **pre-print** (on
  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [bioRXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/),
  ...), get a DOI and credit. :-)

- **Gold open access**: pay a lot of moeny (APC article processing
  charge), typically 3000 -
  [9000](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03324-y) Euros to
  publish your article in a journal under an open access
  licence. **For-profit** publishing (typically **huge profits**). :-(

- **Platinum (diamond) open access**: 100% free to pubish and free to
  read, usually financed by university, funders, research
  organisations centrally. **Non-profit publishing**. :-)

- **Read and publish 'transformative' agreements**: combining
  subscriptions (to read) and APCs into big deals, this (1)
  obfuscating real costs, (2) lock-in into a contract with specific
  publishers, and (3) discriminate against institutions/countries that
  can't afford them (see this
  [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TUuoHV8yA0TSLUCo0PhrzfR5lwWruZQibKimOoVVJ6E/edit?usp=sharing)
  by Corina Logan and Dieter Lukas for more details). :-(

Not everybody has the privilege to be open.

There are different levels in how open one wants, or how open one could afford to be.


Every voice and support is welcome.

## Ethical publishing

---
class: middle


.left-col-70[

[Corina Logan](http://corinalogan.com/)
([@LoganCorina](https://twitter.com/LoganCorina) on twitter) started
to talk already many years ago about ethical publishing (for research
dissemination at large). I wasn't immediately sold on the phrasing,
but I now came to the realisation that it's absolutely spot on.

> We should think about the ethical implications of how we perform and
> disseminate our research.

(Thank you Corina).
