I am **not** speaking from authority here. Authority generally comes
from seniority, and in most cases senior academics aren't those that
have much experience in open and reproducible research.


I don't plan listing technical solutions on how to implement open
and reproducible research.


The real challenges are the (academic) environment we are in, the
inertia of academia and the vested interests of many senior actors.

## Open / reproducible != good

A piece of open research doesn't automatically make it good, where
good is defined as of high academic quality.

The **[Mertonian
norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms)** (1942)

- **Communism**: all scientists should have common ownership of scientific
  goods (intellectual property), to promote collective collaboration;
  secrecy is the opposite of this norm.

- **Universalism**: scientific validity is independent of the
  sociopolitical status/personal attributes of its participants.

- **Disinterestedness**: scientific institutions act for the benefit of a
  common scientific enterprise, rather than for the personal gain of
  individuals within them

- **Organised scepticism**: scientific claims should be exposed to
  critical scrutiny before being accepted: both in methodology and
  institutional codes of conduct.

class: middle

**Inverse problems** are hard! (Example and figure borrowed from
[Stephen
Eglen](https://sje30.github.io/talks/2017/cam_eglen.html#inverse-problems-are-hard))


| Score (%) | grade |
|:---------:|:-----:|
| 70-100    |    A  |
| 60-69     |    B  |
| 50-59     |    C  |
| 40-49     |    D  |
| 0-39      |    F  |


- **Forward problem**: I scored 68, what was my grade?

- **Inverse problem**: I got a B, what was my score?

- **Green open access**: post your **pre-print** (on
  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [bioRXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/),
  ...), get a DOI and credit. :-)

- **Gold open access**: pay a lot of money (APC article processing
  charge), typically 3000 -
  [9000](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03324-y) Euros to
  publish your article in a journal under an open access
  licence. **For-profit** publishing (typically **huge profits**). :-(

- **Platinum (diamond) open access**: 100% free to pubish and free to
  read, usually financed by university, funders, research
  organisations centrally. **Non-profit publishing**. :-)

- **Read and publish 'transformative' agreements**: combining
  subscriptions (to read) and APCs into big deals, this (1)
  obfuscating real costs, (2) lock-in into a contract with specific
  publishers, and (3) discriminate against institutions/countries that
  can't afford them (see this

## Why becoming an open research practitioners


---
class: middle

## Why becoming an open research practitioners (1)

- It's the right thing to do. See the **The Mertonian norms**... Or is it?

- **Benefits for your academic career**: [How open science helps
  researchers
  succeed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4973366/) and
  more examples from the [Open as a career
  boost](https://lgatto.github.io/EPFL-open-science/): more citations,
  coverage, available data leads to more citations, open software is
  more likely to be used...

- **Networking opportunities**

- **Get more funding**: Meet funder requirements, and qualify for
  special funds such as the Wellcome Trust [Open Research
  Fund](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/schemes/open-research-fund)


---
class: middle

## Why becoming an open research practitioners (2)

- **Get that promotion**: Open research is increasingly visible and
  recognised in promotion and tenure. See also [Reproducibility and
  open science are starting to matter in tenure and
  promotion](https://cos.io/blog/are-reproducibility-and-open-science-starting-matter-tenure-and-promotion-review/)
  July 14th, 2017, Brian Nosek) and the EU's [Evaluation of Research
  Careers fully acknowledging Open Science
  Practice](https://cdn1.euraxess.org/sites/default/files/policy_library/os-rewards-wgreport-final_integrated_0.pdf)
  defines an Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM):

## But are there any risks?

---
class: middle

> Does it take more time to work openly?

Isn't it worth investing time is managing data in a way that others
(including future self) can find and understand it? That's, IMHO,
particularly important from a group leader's perspective, where I want
to build a corpus of data/software/research that other lab members can
find, mine and re-use.

> Are senior academics always supportive?

No.

> Is there a risk of being scooped?

There certainly is a benefit if releasing one's research early!

---
class: middle, inverse

But, importantly, working with open and reproducible research in mind
**doesn't mean releasing everything prematurely**, it means

- managing research in a way one can find data and results at every
  stage

- one can **reproduce/repeat** results, re-run/compare them with new
  data or different methods/parameters, and

- one can **release** data (or parts thereof) when/if **appropriate**.

class: middle

In my opinion, barriers are not technological, but rather
socio-cultural and political.

- Systemic control and inertia
- Vested interests by people in charge
- Abuse of power dynamics
- Fear of being scooped (an editorial in PLoS Biology on [*The
  importance of being
  second*](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005203)
  and, and how they prefer to focus on *complementary research*,
  recognising its important role in reproducibility of science.)
- Fear of not being credited
- Fear of errors and public humiliation, risk for reputation
- Fear of information overload
- ...
- Fear of becoming less competitive in a over-competitive market!

Many if not all of these fears are only **perceived** risks.


---
class: middle, inverse, center

## Why reproducibility is important

---
class: middle

For **scientific reasons**: think reproducibility crisis.

For **political reasons**: public trust in science, in data, in
experts; without (public) trust in science and research, there won't
be any funding anymore; lack of (public) trust in science leads to
poor public health decisions!

---
class: middle, inverse, center

## But what do we mean by reproducibility?

---
class: middle

**Repeat** my experiment i.e. obtain the same tables/graphs/results
using the same setup (data, software, ...) in the same lab or on the
same computer.


**Reproduce** an experiment (not mine) i.e. obtain the same
tables/graphs/results in a different lab or on a different computer,
using the same setup.


**Replicate** an experiment, i.e. obtain the same (similar enough)
tables/graphs/results in a different set up.


Finally, **re-use** the information/knowledge from one experiment to
run a different experiment with the aim to confirm results from
scratch.

---
class: middle

Another view (from a talk by [Kirstie
Whitaker](https://figshare.com/articles/Publishing_a_reproducible_paper/4720996/1)):

|                    | Same Data | Different Data |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Same Code**      | reproduce | replicate      |
| **Different Code** | robust    | generalisable  |

## (Computational) Reproducibility Is Not The Point

But rather

## The goal is trust, verification and guarantees


---
class: middle

## The goal is trust, verification and guarantees

- **Trust in Reporting** - result is accurately reported
- **Trust in Implementation** - analysis code successfully implements
  chosen methods
- **Statistical Trust** - data and methods are (still) appropriate
- **Scientific Trust** - result convincingly supports claim(s) about
  underlying systems or truths

class: middle

## Be an open research practitioners

Includes (but not limited to)

---
class: middle

## Preprints are the best!

Read, post, review and cite **preprints** (see
[ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/) for lots of resources about
preprints).

## Promoting open research through peer review

- Accept sound/valid research and provide constructive comments

and hence

- Focus on the validity of the research by inspecting the data,
  software and method. If the methods and/or data fail, the rest is
  meaningless.

(See [The role of peer-reviewers in promoting open
science](https://rawgit.com/lgatto/2017-03-30-OSC-peerreview/master/slides.html)
for details.)

---
class: middle

Make sure that the data adhere to the
**[FAIR](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) principles**:

## Findable and Accessible and Interoperable and Reusable

(and clearly, supplementary information in research manuscripts don't
comply!)

---
class: middle

## Think about open peer review

In particular, publication of (possibly anonymised) peer review
reports and decision letters. eLife has very recently announced that
they are implementing a [**publish, then review**
model](https://elifesciences.org/articles/64910) of publishing:

> From July 2021 eLife will only review manuscripts already published
> as preprints, and will focus its editorial process on producing
> public reviews to be posted alongside the preprints.

---
class: middle

## Registered reports

Define you data collection and analysis protocol in advance. Get it
reviewed and, if accepted, get right to publish once data have been
collected and analysed, irrespective of the (positive or negative)
result.


See [Open science challenges, benefits and tips in early career and
beyond](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000246)
(2019).

## Make allies

This is **very** important!

- Other ECR
- Librarians
- Data stewards/champions
- Research Software engineers
- On/off-line networking

Collaborative work and cooperation is certainly one important concept
that gravitates around open science/research (see the Mertonian norm
of *communism*), but that isn't necessary nor sufficient for open
science.
